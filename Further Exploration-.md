index.html: The main HTML file that displays the emulator interface and loads the JavaScript components.
cpu.js: Defines the Central Processing Unit with functions for fetching, decoding, and executing instructions.
memory.js: Implements the memory component, storing data and instructions.
io.js: Handles input/output operations, allowing interaction with the emulator.

Running the Emulator:

Open index.html in your development environment.
The webpage will display an interface for providing instructions and observing the emulator's output.
Enter simple instructions (explained in the code comments) and press "Run" to see the emulator process them.
Understanding the Code:

Each JavaScript file focuses on a specific component of the computer:

cpu.js: This file defines the CPU's functionality. It reads instructions from memory, decodes them, and performs operations based on the instruction type (e.g., adding values, storing data in memory).
memory.js: This file acts as the computer's memory, holding both data and instructions as an array. The CPU interacts with memory to read and write data.
io.js: This file handles user interaction with the emulator. It allows you to input instructions and displays the output generated by the CPU during program execution.
Embrace the Journey:

This is a simplified representation of a computer, but it provides a solid foundation for understanding how these machines work at their core. Explore the code, experiment with different instructions, and see how they manipulate data and influence the emulator's behavior.

# Further Exploration:

The included code offers a basic framework. You can extend it to:

Implement additional instructions for more complex operations.
Develop a visual representation of the memory and its contents.
Design an assembly language format for user-friendly instruction creation.
